# Welcome to Chat-ster!

Even wondered  how to keep your loved ones  together in these times of distress and  chaos, (and of course mutual depression!), we're here and we have your back!

Come join us in this expedition to help aid, in this situation!


## Installation

1. yarn 
2. yarn start

## Improvements

1. Could have been functional components(hooks) instead  of  class components, but due  to the stinget timeline and (my fever), I preferred not to  have useMemo and useCallback setups in order to avoid infinite re-rendering.

2. Wanted to add comments to every function , to describe their use-cases but again the situation!

3. Could have had more re-usability and a modular code and folder structure.

Thanks!

## Enjoy.
